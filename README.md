# Shape-calculators
Hello and thankyou for using my calculator
The calculator in the folder was made in two hours as a hobby project.
To correctly operate the claculator you must use the latest version of python.
When inputing the shape you want to calculate area of you must spell it the same as it is spelt in the options.
I hope you enjoy
